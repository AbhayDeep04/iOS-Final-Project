## Overview

### Description

A to do list app that asks users to upload proof of having completed their to dos. End to end encrypted users keep track of each other's to dos.

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:**  easy to use navigation, Camera requirement, Portrait List View
- **Story:** Users get to stay in check for their personal and professional goals by an actual human being. In turn, they get to keep others in check and harness motivation through other's progress.
- **Market:** Anyone trying to improve in consistency in general.
- **Habit:** The user uses the app daily, or as frequently as their to dos arise.
